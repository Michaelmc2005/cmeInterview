			<h2 class="about-me">A brief overview of my work</h2>
			<p>I've always loved programming and teaching myself new things, since a young age I have enjoyed making things, 
                and as I got older, the things I know how to make have gotten significantly cooler.

			  <h2>Catalyst Generation Innovation</h2>
			  <p> I was in the winning team of the Catalyst generation innovation work experience program where my team programmed a fully functional website in html, css and javascript. As a bonus to our project I developed my own Snapchat Augmented Reality 3D depth mapping filter in javascript that gained over 2500 uses in the first 3 days of release, and allowed users to raise awareness for deforestation. This created a solution to the problem statement that was provided to the team by our partner company for the event, ‘Instil’</p>

				  <h2>Sentinus Young Innovators Winner</h2>
				  <p>I became interested in Virtual Reality development and showcased my 3d modelling abilities which I taught myself over the past 4 years at the Whitla Hall, Queen's University, and this lead me to win the Sentinus Young Innovators 2022 competition in October, This achievement entitles me to be the only person to represent Northern Ireland, at a global event in Dallas, Texas in May this year. This event is the world's largest pre-college STEM event. </p>

						<h2>Computer Science A Level Projects</h2>
						<p>As a result of my computer science A level I developed two systems using c sharp and windows forms to create a quiz game and a booking system for a department store. These projects have allowed me to learn about database programming, SQL Querying and Full stack deployment application development</p>

				<h2>Advancing Technology at Lagan College</h2>
				<p>Due to my achievements regarding Virtual Reality development, I was able to allow my school, Lagan College entry to the Carson Award, resulting in £2000 funding for new technology, this technology has been paired with my Learning Application that I have programmed, and will allow students to learn with the help of VR</p>

			  <h2>My Virtual Reality Learning Application</h2>
			  <p>I have developed a Virtual Reality Learning application in Unity with a C# backend, this application has already won awards and has innovated the technology used in my school settings aswell as my own personal career, it will be the forefront of my STEM project at Regeneron ISEF in May. The application has been designed to allow students to test-run a subject before committing to study it at a further level, such as A Level or GCSE </p>
